Is this safe?

YES - it is

why is it made - git desktop is cheeks and i like this dont judge, its also just simple instead of opening your browser

why sign in - so you can upload files

why does it need access to my private info - just so it can say hey username

who are you - roan

why does my antivirus pop up - it hoepfully shouldn't but your computers gonna hate an exe unverified sending web requests because fair enough

i dont trust this - dont use it, this was convenient for me and if you dont like it, that's okay
