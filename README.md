# Easy-git-push-and-pull
I made it possible to upload fat files - splitting is fun and hopefully not corrupting

Is this safe?

YES - it is

why is it made - git desktop is cheeks and i like this dont judge, its also just simple instead of opening your browser

why sign in - so you can upload files

why does it need access to my private info - just so it can say hey username

who are you - roan

why does my antivirus pop up - it hoepfully shouldn't but your computers gonna hate an exe unverified sending web requests because fair enough

i dont trust this - dont use it, this was convenient for me and if you dont like it, that's okay

copyright me but like whos enforcing that shit anyway, the icon was drawn by dapaul so no stealy
